# Wejay with GraphQL using Relay

This is a test of the experimental Relay Hooks API using
[`reason-relay`](https://github.com/zth/reason-relay/). It consists of a small
GraphQL API for accessing a Sonos system and a web that displays what's currently
playing as well as upcoming tracks.

## Get started

The project uses [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)

```
npx lerna bootstrap
```
